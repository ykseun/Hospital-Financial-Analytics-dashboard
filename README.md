## 📈 Business Insights

### **🔹 1. Revenue Growth & Fluctuations**  
The hospital generated $274K in total revenue, showing clear fluctuations between quarters:

- Peaks occurred in 2022 Q1 ($38K) and 2022 Q4 ($44K) 
- A noticeable decline appears in 2023, dropping to $9K by Q3  
  - This indicates reduced patient volume, seasonal decline, or operational bottlenecks.

### **🔹 2. Profitability Analysis**  
With Total Expenses = $189K vs. Total Revenue = $274K, the hospital maintains a 30.8% profit margin, which is strong for a general healthcare facility.

Top profitable procedures include:

- Heart Bypass Surgery – 31.9%  
- Appendectomy – 31.2%  
- Skin Biopsy – 31.4%  

This suggests that surgical and diagnostic services are core financial drivers.

### **🔹 3. High-Performing Specialties**  
The following specialties contribute the most revenue:

1. **Dermatology – $68K**  
2. **Cardiology – $61K**  
3. **Neurology – $59K**  

These three specialties alone account for **over 2/3 of total hospital earnings**, positioning them as strategic areas for resource allocation and staffing.

### **🔹 4. Patient & Doctor Operational Metrics**  
- **Number of Doctors:** 81  
- **Number of Patients:** 86  

This doctor-to-patient ratio suggests **high physician availability**, potentially supporting faster service delivery and shorter wait times.

Specialty-level insights show:

- Orthopedics and Pediatrics handle low patient volumes → potential underutilization  
- Dermatology sees both high patient volume and high revenue → strategic growth area  


### **🔹 6. Patient Visit Trends**  
Patient visits peak in 2022 Q1 (32 visits) and 2022 Q4 (36 visits), aligning with the revenue peaks.

This confirms:

> Higher patient volume = higher revenue = higher profit**  

Seasonal dips appear consistently in Q3 across years.
